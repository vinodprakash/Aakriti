                            <span>You have been asked many times: What will you carry with yourself if you're marooned on an island? </span>
                            <div><p><i>But this question has been revised in the past few years, thanks to the fashion industry. So, now the question is: If you can only fit three items in your clutch, what will they be?</i></p>
                            

                            <p>The trend started in 2012 and now these tiny bags were seen at every red carpet. Some of the styles are just straight up small. It's one fashion item that can make you examine what you really need to keep with you at all time.</p>
                            <p>It's more like the fashion industry is forcing you to narrow down your style choices to just three belongings. So, the next time you want to carry a clutch, just be prepared to carry only what you need.</p></div>

                            <b><span>the black colour of fashion industry</span></b>

                            <div>
                            <p><i>The fruity hue is a ramp favorite and is gaining popularity as a red carpet option too</i></p>
                            <p>
                                No, it is not the TV show we are talking about! There was a time when colors like red and black rules the red carpet and design circles perpetually. But with designers experimenting with more and more bold hues day by day, the colour orange has gained a new life on the red carpet. More and more supermodels and actresses are sporting variations of the fruity hue in all their outings. </p>
                             <p> 
                                The fiery hue in shades ranging from sunshine orange to pumpkin shade to candy floss orange to a carroty red - every shade of this color is in vogue lately. Wearing a simple LBD or a long red gown to a party seems to be passe now. It is the bright and bold shades that are turning heads and yes, orange is on top of the list of most fashionistas.
                             </p>
                             <p>So stack up on this unusual colour. Make sure you buy a nice orange one-piece that ends just above the knees for the summers; or go for a flowy orange top with skinny jeans for that causal outing. You can even buy a long orange maxi dress for a beach outing!</p>

                            <b><span> FASHION OR ANTI-FASHION? </span></b>

                                Fashion has always been repetition of ideas and all about reliving and creating new trends. With every New Year, shoppers and retailers are bombarded with the latest items and looks for the season. Designers and fashion forecasters predict the future of fashion and the styles that will reign on and off the runway. Some styles are classic and linger forever while some are ephemeral. Staying trendy requires one to follow and keep track of the season's colours, prints, styles, and looks to stay hip.</p>
                                <p>The latest buzz that has hit the fashion scene is the anti-fashion trend called "Normcore". An American trend forecasting team coined the term which is an amalgamation of two main words namely "normal" and "hardcore". They predicted normcore to be the next big fashion movement. The term has caused fashion frenzy and after a leading magazine wrote about the look, it went viral online. </p>
                                <p>After all what is Normcore? The basic attitude of the normcore style is unlike any fashion trend to look different and stand apart, it is rather a look to fit in the crowd and a conscious effort to look effortless. For the team behind the term, Normcore is a result of saturation from the trying hard to stand out phase and changing wardrobes to look stylish and suit a trend. The exhaustion from the constant change in fashion cycles has led to adaptation of styles that are basic and is heading towards wearing more staples. </p>
                                <p>Normcore is suitable for individuals who do not want to associate themselves with fleeting trends and seasonal must haves. The forecasters of Normcore have taken fashion cues from popular icons like Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Jobs, describing their styles to be the epitome of normcore. The laid back looks of the 90s with oversized T-shirts, boxy jeans, and the fleece have become a perfect ensemble to stay aggressively unfashionable. Large fashion retailers like Jack & Jones, Esprit, Abercrombie & Fitch, Superdry, Woolrich, Desigual, Scotch & Soda, Closed, and Marc O'Polo are endorsing the trend in a big way with clothes suiting the normcore. </p>
                                <p>While some fashion critics believe that Normcore is just a part and parcel of the normal course of a fashion cycle. And fashion has always been about having an individual style and looking a certain way. Normcore steals the whole idea of being unique and the thrill of new...
