								<p><i>Fold over clutch bags are the latest rage with stylish women.</i></p>

								Clutch bags have taken the world by the storm. From the biggest fashion designers to actresses all over the world to business women and even a homemaker - a clutch bag has made home in every woman's wardrobe.
								</p>
								<p>   But what has caught fancy of millions lately is the fold over clutch bag - a clutch made of cloth or leather or any such material, which is then folded into half and carried with panache. The biggest hits when it comes to a fold over clutch are animal prints, leather, sequin, candy floss colored, print messages, animated characters, floral prints are in for fold over clutch bags.</p>

								<p><i>The fruity hue is a ramp favorite and is gaining popularity as a red carpet option too</i></p>
								<p>
								No, it is not the TV show we are talking about! There was a time when colors like red and black rules the red carpet and design circles perpetually. But with designers experimenting with more and more bold hues day by day, the colour orange has gained a new life on the red carpet. More and more supermodels and actresses are sporting variations of the fruity hue in all their outings. </p>

								The fiery hue in shades ranging from sunshine orange to pumpkin shade to candy floss orange to a carroty red - every shade of this color is in vogue lately. Wearing a simple LBD or a long red gown to a party seems to be passe now. It is the bright and bold shades that are turning heads and yes, orange is on top of the list of most fashionistas.
								</p>
								<p>So stack up on this unusual colour. Make sure you buy a nice orange one-piece that ends just above the knees for the summers; or go for a flowy orange top with skinny jeans for that causal outing. You can even buy a long orange maxi dress for a beach outing!</p>

							<div class="wd-info-desc">
								<p>
								Fashion has always been repetition of ideas and all about reliving and creating new trends. With every New Year, shoppers and retailers are bombarded with the latest items and looks for the season. Designers and fashion forecasters predict the future of fashion and the styles that will reign on and off the runway. Some styles are classic and linger forever while some are ephemeral. Staying trendy requires one to follow and keep track of the season's colours, prints, styles, and looks to stay hip.</p>
								<p>The latest buzz that has hit the fashion scene is the anti-fashion trend called "Normcore". An American trend forecasting team coined the term which is an amalgamation of two main words namely "normal" and "hardcore". They predicted normcore to be the next big fashion movement. The term has caused fashion frenzy and after a leading magazine wrote about the look, it went viral online. </p>

								<h2>NOMCORE</h2>

							<div class="wd-info-desc">
								<p>After all what is Normcore? The basic attitude of the normcore style is unlike any fashion trend to look different and stand apart, it is rather a look to fit in the crowd and a conscious effort to look effortless. For the team behind the term, Normcore is a result of saturation from the trying hard to stand out phase and changing wardrobes to look stylish and suit a trend. The exhaustion from the constant change in fashion cycles has led to adaptation of styles that are basic and is heading towards wearing more staples. </p>
								<p>Normcore is suitable for individuals who do not want to associate themselves with fleeting trends and seasonal must haves. The forecasters of Normcore have taken fashion cues from popular icons like Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Jobs, describing their styles to be the epitome of normcore.</p>

								The laid back looks of the 90s with oversized T-shirts, boxy jeans, and the fleece have become a perfect ensemble to stay aggressively unfashionable. Large fashion retailers like Jack & Jones, Esprit, Abercrombie & Fitch, Superdry, Woolrich, Desigual, Scotch & Soda, Closed, and Marc O'Polo are endorsing the trend in a big way with clothes suiting the normcore. </p>
